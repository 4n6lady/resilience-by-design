# resilience-by-design
Resilience by Design is a practical toolkit for security and incident response leaders. It's not theory. It's a set of resources designed to be used during 1:1s, after major incidents, in quarterly planning, or whenever you're trying to figure out whether your team is actually sustainable or just quietly holding together.
