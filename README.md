# Resilience by Design

**A practical toolkit for security and incident response leaders building sustainable teams.**

---

## What This Is

Security and incident response work will always involve urgency, ambiguity, and high stakes. 
That isn't going to change. What can change is whether teams are set up to sustain performance 
over time, or whether they depend on quiet overextension that accumulates until something breaks.

This repository contains practical resources for leaders who want to recognize early 
burnout signals, design for recovery, reduce dependence on hero culture, and build 
sustainable performance into how their teams operate.

Everything here is open and free to use, adapt, and share.

---

## Who This Is For

- **Security and incident response managers** looking for structured ways to support 
  their teams beyond standard operational practices
- **Team leads and senior responders** who want to advocate for sustainable practices 
  within their organizations
- **Anyone leading high-stakes, high-pressure technical teams** where the patterns 
  described here feel familiar

## Background

This toolkit accompanies a three-part article series on burnout in security teams:

1. [What Burnout in Security Teams Really Costs Us](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-burnout-security-teams-really-costs-us-shannon-brazil-i2gwc/?trackingId=7hNtCYEFQw%2B8IVT6rtWL7A%3D%3D) — How burnout hides in 
   high-performing teams and what it actually costs in decision quality, resilience, 
   and long-term effectiveness
2. [The Leadership Blind Spot in Security Teams](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/leadership-blind-spot-security-teams-shannon-brazil-yr8wc/?trackingId=7hNtCYEFQw%2B8IVT6rtWL7A%3D%3D) — How leadership systems 
   can unintentionally reinforce unsustainable patterns
3. [Burnout Is Feedback: What Effective Leaders Do Differently](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/burnout-feedback-what-effective-leaders-do-shannon-brazil-4rgnc/?trackingId=7hNtCYEFQw%2B8IVT6rtWL7A%3D%3D) — What 
   effective leaders do to make sustained performance possible

The articles provide the reasoning and context. The resources here are designed to put 
that thinking into practice.

## How to Use This

**If you're a manager or team lead**, start with the 
[full toolkit](toolkit/resilience-by-design-toolkit.md). It provides context for why each 
area matters, patterns to watch for, reflection questions, and concrete actions. From 
there, pick the template or guide most relevant to what your team needs right now. 
You don't need to implement everything at once.

**If you're a senior responder or individual contributor** who recognizes these patterns 
on your team, start with the 
[Bringing This to Your Leadership](guides/bringing-this-to-your-leadership.md) guide. 
It's designed to help you frame this conversation in terms that resonate with leadership.

**If you want to run a team session**, the 
[Workshop Facilitator Guide](workshop/facilitator-guide.md) provides a structured 
format. The 
[Psychological Safety Team Discussion Guide](guides/psych-safety-team-discussion.md) 
offers a lighter-weight option for a team meeting or offsite.

## A Note on This Work

I built these resources as a practitioner, not a researcher. I've spent a decade in 
security incident response—as a responder, a team lead, and a manager. I've made 
the mistakes described in the toolkit. I've been the person who couldn't disconnect and 
the leader who absorbed too much and called it responsibility.

These resources reflect what I've learned about what actually works. They're imperfect 
and they'll continue to evolve. If you adapt them for your team or your context, I'd 
genuinely love to hear about it.
