# Manager Self-Assessment

## A Private Reflection on Your Own Role in the System

**Part of the [Resilience by Design](../README.md) toolkit**

---

## Purpose

Everything in the Resilience by Design toolkit talks about what leaders 
should do for their teams. This document is about what's happening to you.   

Security and incident response leadership carries a specific kind of 
pressure. You're responsible for the team's performance, the quality of 
the response, the customer experience, the well-being of the people who 
report to you, and the expectations of the organization above you. You 
absorb pressure from every direction and redistribute it in ways that 
hopefully protect your team while still meeting the mission.   

That work is important. It's also expensive, and the cost often isn't 
visible to anyone—sometimes including yourself.   

Many leaders in security reinforced unsustainable patterns without 
realizing it. We step in to absorb extra load. We shield our teams from 
organizational stress. We defer our own limits because the work feels 
urgent and the team needs stability. In the short term, this feels like 
responsible leadership. Over time, it builds a system that depends on us 
consistently operating above sustainable capacity.   

And because leaders are often the ones who set the tone for the team, 
the way you handle your own limits—whether you acknowledge them, whether 
you model sustainable behavior, whether you actually disconnect when you 
tell your team to disconnect—shapes what's normalized for everyone else.   

This assessment is for you. Nobody else needs to see it. Its purpose is 
to create a private space where you can be honest about how you're 
operating, what you're carrying, and whether you're leading in a way 
that's sustainable—not just for the team, but for yourself.

## When to Use This

- **Quarterly**, alongside the 
  [Quarterly Team Resilience Review](quarterly-resilience-review.md)
- When you notice that you're consistently running above what feels 
  sustainable but haven't stopped to examine why
- When someone asks "how are you doing?" and you realize you don't 
  actually know the honest answer
- After a particularly demanding period—a major incident, an 
  organizational change, a stretch of sustained high-pressure operations

---

## Part 1: How You're Actually Doing

These questions are simple. The honest answers may not be.   

**How are you doing right now?**   

Not the answer you'd give your team, your peers, or your manager. The 
real one.   


**When was the last time you felt genuinely rested?**   

Not "I had a weekend where nothing caught fire." Rested in a way where 
you came back with capacity, clarity, and something resembling energy.   


**What's the thing you're carrying right now that nobody else sees?**   

The context, the worry, the unresolved problem, the situation you're 
managing quietly. The thing that occupies your mind when you're 
supposedly off.   


**If someone could take one thing off your plate with no consequences, 
what would it be?**   


**Are you okay?**   

Genuinely. Not functionally. Okay.   


---

## Part 2: Your Relationship with Your Own Limits

### Questions

**When was the last time you said "no" to something or pushed back on 
a demand?**   

Not redirected or negotiated—actually declined.   


**When was the last time you told your team or your manager that you 
were at capacity?**   


**How often in the past quarter did you absorb something "just this 
once"?**   

Extra load, stepping in to cover, handling something that wasn't your 
responsibility because it felt faster or easier than the alternative.   

[ ] Rarely — it was genuinely occasional   
[ ] Several times — more than I'd like   
[ ] Frequently — "just this once" has become a pattern   
[ ] I'm not sure — I don't track this   


If it's become a pattern, what's driving it?   

[ ] Nobody else can do it (capacity issue)   
[ ] Nobody else will do it (cultural issue)   
[ ] It feels faster/easier for me to do it (control issue)   
[ ] I'm not comfortable asking others to take it on (trust issue)   
[ ] I haven't thought about it until now   
[ ] Other:   


**Do you have someone—a peer, a mentor, a trusted colleague—where 
you can be honest about how you're doing?**   

Not someone you report to. Not someone who reports to you. Someone 
where you can drop the leadership posture and be a person who is 
having a hard time, if that's what's true.   
[ ] Yes, and I use that relationship regularly   
[ ] Yes, but I don't use it as often as I should   
[ ] Not really   


If not, this is worth addressing. Leaders who have no space to be 
honest about their own limits eventually lose the ability to 
accurately assess them.

## Part 3: What You're Modeling   

Whether you intend it or not, your behavior teaches your team what's 
normal. This section examines what you're inadvertently normalizing 
through your own patterns.   

### Questions

**Do you take your own time off?**   
[ ] Yes, and I genuinely disconnect   
[ ] I take time off but stay partially engaged (checking messages,
responding to "just the urgent stuff")   
[ ] I rarely take time off   
[ ] I take time off on paper but don't actually disconnect   


**Does your team know when you're off?**   

If you take time off but continue to send messages, respond to 
questions, or engage with incidents, your team receives the message
that time off is not real. Regardless of what you say.
[ ] Yes — they know, and they see me disconnect   
[ ] They know I'm off but see me engaged anyway   
[ ] It's ambiguous   


**What time do you send messages?**   

Think about the past month. Late nights, early mornings, weekends. 
Even if you don't expect a response, the timestamp sends a signal 
about what's normal.   
[ ] Generally during working hours   
[ ] Frequently outside working hours   
[ ] I haven't paid attention to this   


If frequently outside working hours: does the platform you're using 
show timestamps to your team? If so, that's a data point they're 
receiving about your expectations, whether you intend it or not.   

**When a high-pressure incident is underway, what do you do?**   
[ ] I trust the assigned responder and stay available if needed   
[ ] I monitor closely but let the team lead   
[ ] I tend to step in and take an active role, even when someone
else is assigned   
[ ] I absorb the coordination and communication burden to shield
the team   


There isn't a single right answer here, but each pattern has 
implications. Consistently stepping in or absorbing the coordination 
load may protect the team in the moment while building dependence on 
your presence and preventing others from developing under pressure.   

**If your team were describing your behavior to a new hire, what 
would they say about how you manage your own limits?**   

Be honest. Not what you'd want them to say. What they'd actually say 
based on what they observe.   


---

## Part 4: Structural Dependence   

This section examines whether the system you lead depends on your 
personal overextension to function.   

### Questions

**If you were completely unavailable for two weeks—no messages, no 
check-ins, no "just a quick look"—what would break?**    

Be specific. Not "things would probably be fine." What specifically 
would be affected?   


**What decisions on your team currently require you?**   

Not decisions you'd prefer to be involved in—decisions that literally 
cannot be made without you.   


**Are there decisions your team *could* make without you but won't?**   

If so, why? Is it a clarity issue (they don't know they're empowered), 
a trust issue (they're not confident in their authority), or a cultural 
issue (decisions always route upward regardless)?    


**Who would lead the team if you stepped away?**   

Not theoretically. Is there someone who could realistically step in and 
maintain operational effectiveness? Have they been given the context, 
authority, and development to do so?    


**Have you built your own succession readiness, or does the team's 
resilience depend on your continued presence at current capacity?**   


---

## Part 5: Alignment Between Intent and Practice

Leaders generally have good intentions about sustainability. The gap is 
usually between what we intend and what we practice. This section examines 
that gap.   

### Questions

**Do you tell your team to disconnect after hard incidents?**   
[ ] Yes   
[ ] Sometimes   
[ ] Not explicitly   


**Do you disconnect after hard incidents?**   
[ ] Yes   
[ ] Sometimes   
[ ] Rarely   


If there's a gap between those two answers, your team is receiving 
contradictory signals. What you do will always carry more weight than 
what you say.   

---

**Do you tell your team that it's okay to say "I'm at capacity"?**   
[ ] Yes   
[ ] I've implied it but haven't said it explicitly   
[ ] Not specifically   


**When was the last time you said "I'm at capacity" to anyone?**   

---

**Do you believe burnout is a systemic issue rather than an individual 
failure?**   
[ ] Yes   


**When someone on your team shows signs of burning out, what's your 
first instinct?**   

Be honest about the instinct, not the considered response.   
 ] This person needs support and the system needs to change   
[ ] This person needs better boundaries or time management   
[ ] I need to reduce their load temporarily   
[ ] I need to absorb some of their work myself   
[ ] I worry about the impact on the team's delivery   
[ ] I feel responsible for not catching it earlier   


Multiple answers are fine. The instinct matters because it reveals 
what you default to under pressure, which is when your response 
matters most.

## Part 6: What Needs to Change

Based on everything you've reflected on, identify what's most 
important.   

**What's one thing about how you operate that isn't sustainable?**   

Not the thing that would be nice to change. The thing that will 
eventually cost you or your team if it doesn't change.   

**What's preventing that change?**   
[ ] Operational demands — there's genuinely no space right now   
[ ] Organizational expectations — the system above me requires this   
[ ] Habit — I've been operating this way so long it feels normal   
[ ] Identity — this is tied to how I see myself as a leader   
[ ] I haven't prioritized it   
[ ] I'm not sure   


**What's one thing you could do in the next 30 days?**   

Not a sweeping change. One specific, concrete thing.   

 
**What support would you need to make that change?**   

From your manager, your peers, your team, or your organization.   


**Is there something you need to ask for that you haven't asked for?**   


---

## Part 7: Commitments

Write down no more than three commitments for the coming quarter.     
Make them specific enough that you'll know whether you followed through.   

| Commitment | I'll Know It Worked When... |
|------------|---------------------------|
| 1.         |                           |
| 2.         |                           |
| 3.         |                           |

## Keeping a Record

Like the [Quarterly Team Resilience Review](quarterly-resilience-review.md), 
this assessment is most valuable when repeated over time. Save each 
completed version and compare them.   

Patterns to watch across quarters:

- Are you giving the same answers about being at capacity each time? 
  If so, nothing is changing.
- Are your commitments from previous quarters actually being met? If 
  they keep carrying forward uncompleted, something is blocking them 
  that you haven't addressed.
- Is your overall trajectory toward sustainability, or are you slowly 
  depleting?
- Have you built any more structural resilience into your own role, 
  or does the system still depend on your personal overextension?

| Quarter | How I Was Doing | Key Commitment | Did I Follow Through? | Trajectory |
|---------|----------------|----------------|----------------------|------------|
|         |                |                |                      |            |
|         |                |                |                      |            |
|         |                |                |                      |            |

## A Final Thought

There's a particular trap that security and incident response leaders 
fall into. The work is genuinely important. The stakes are real. The 
people on your team are counting on you. And so it feels irresponsible 
to admit that you're struggling, to step back, or to prioritize your 
own sustainability.   

But here's the thing: a depleted leader makes worse decisions, misses 
signals they would have caught, and models the exact overextension 
they're trying to protect their team from. Taking care of yourself isn't 
a distraction from the mission. It's a prerequisite for leading it well.   

You can't pour from an empty cup is a cliché for a reason, but in 
incident response the version that's more accurate is this: you can 
pour from a nearly empty cup for a surprisingly long time before anyone 
notices, including yourself. That's what makes it dangerous.   

The strongest security leaders I've worked with aren't the ones who 
endure the most. They're the ones who are honest about what they're 
carrying, who build systems that don't depend on their personal 
sacrifice, and who understand that their own sustainability is a 
leadership responsibility—not a personal luxury.   

If this assessment surfaced something uncomfortable, that's it doing 
its job. Sit with it. Decide what to do about it. And come back next 
quarter and see whether anything changed.
