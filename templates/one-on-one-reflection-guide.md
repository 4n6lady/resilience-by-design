# 1:1 Reflection Guide

## Supporting Sustainable Performance Through Regular Check-Ins

**Part of the [Resilience by Design](../README.md) toolkit**

## Purpose

This guide provides structured reflection questions for managers to use during 
regular 1:1s with team members. It's not a script—it's a resource to draw from 
when you want to move beyond status updates and check on how someone is 
actually doing.

Most 1:1s in security and incident response teams default to operational 
topics: case updates, project status, blockers. Those conversations matter. 
But they rarely surface the patterns that predict burnout—because burnout 
doesn't announce itself through task lists. It hides in how the work feels, 
how recovery is going, and whether someone's capacity is being quietly 
exceeded.

These questions are designed to make that visible before it becomes a problem.

## How to Use This

- **Don't run through every question in a single session.** Pick one or two 
  that feel relevant based on what you're observing. These are meant to be 
  used over time, across multiple conversations.

- **Start with the lighter questions** if you haven't had this kind of 
  conversation with someone before. Trust is built gradually. Jumping straight 
  to "are you burning out?" with someone who hasn't experienced psychological 
  safety from you will likely produce a polished "I'm fine."

- **Listen more than you problem-solve.** The instinct to immediately fix 
  what someone raises is strong, especially for leaders in incident response 
  who are trained to resolve things quickly. Resist it. Sometimes the most 
  valuable thing is that someone said it out loud and you heard it.

- **Pay attention to what isn't said.** If someone consistently deflects 
  these questions or gives brief answers, that's data too. It may mean the 
  trust isn't there yet, or it may mean they're in a place where they don't 
  have the energy to reflect.

- **Follow up.** If someone shares something meaningful, reference it in a 
  later conversation. Nothing undermines psychological safety faster than 
  asking someone to be vulnerable and then never mentioning it again.

## Questions by Theme

### Workload and Capacity

These questions help surface whether someone's current load is sustainable 
or whether they're quietly operating above capacity.

- What's taking more energy than it should right now?
- Is there anything on your plate that feels like it shouldn't be yours?
- When was the last time you had a week that felt manageable?
- Are you carrying anything that other people don't see?
- If you had to drop one thing this week without guilt, what would it be?

### Recovery and Disconnection

In incident response, the line between "on" and "off" blurs easily. 
These questions check whether recovery is actually happening.

- When you're off rotation, are you actually off—or are you still checking in?
- After the last major incident, did you feel like you had space to 
  decompress before the next thing?
- What does a good recovery day actually look like for you?
- Is there anything making it harder to disconnect right now?
- When was the last time you took time off and it actually felt restful?

### Engagement and Curiosity

Declining curiosity and engagement are early burnout signals that are 
easy to miss because the person is still delivering.

- Is there anything you're working on right now that genuinely interests you?
- Do you feel like you have time to learn or explore, or is everything 
  reactive right now?
- When was the last time you worked on something that felt like growth 
  rather than maintenance?
- Is there anything about how we work that you'd change if you could?
- Are there conversations happening on the team that you've stopped 
  engaging with? What changed?

### Role and Recognition

These questions help identify whether someone's actual contribution 
matches what's being seen and valued.

- Do you feel like the work you're doing is visible to the people who 
  need to see it?
- Is there work you're doing regularly that doesn't show up in any of our 
  metrics or reviews?
- Are you doing things that aren't officially your responsibility but have 
  become your default?
- Do you feel like you can say no to things right now, and that it would 
  actually be respected?

### Support and Safety

These questions only work if the person trusts that honesty won't cost 
them. If you haven't built that trust yet, start elsewhere and come back.

- Is there anything you need from me that you're not getting?
- Is there something about how I manage or how the team operates that 
  makes things harder for you?
- When things get hard, do you feel like you can flag it? What makes 
  that easier or harder?
- Is there anything you've wanted to say in a team setting but didn't? 
  What stopped you?
- If you were at your limit, would you tell me? What would need to be 
  true for that to feel safe?

## Patterns to Watch Across Conversations

Individual 1:1s are valuable. But the real insight comes from noticing 
patterns over time and across your team.

- **Is the same person consistently describing unsustainable workload?** 
  That's a structural problem, not a time management problem.
- **Are multiple people mentioning difficulty disconnecting?** That may 
  indicate a cultural norm, not an individual habit.
- **Has someone gone from engaged and curious to flat and transactional?** 
  That shift is one of the earliest and most reliable burnout indicators.
- **Is someone consistently saying everything is fine when other signals 
  suggest otherwise?** Don't push, but don't ignore it either. Create 
  more opportunities for honesty and watch whether anything shifts.
- **Are you hearing the same friction points from different people?** 
  That's system feedback. Act on it.

## A Note for Leaders

These questions require something from you too. If you ask someone whether 
they feel safe flagging their limits and they say no, you need to be 
willing to hear that without defensiveness. If someone tells you they're 
carrying invisible work, you need to be willing to do something about it, 
even if the solution isn't immediate.

The fastest way to shut these conversations down is to ask for honesty 
and then not respond to it. The second fastest way is to only have these 
conversations when things are already visibly wrong.

Build them into your regular rhythm. The signal comes from consistency, 
not from any single conversation.
