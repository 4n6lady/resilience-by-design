# Post-Incident Team Check-In Guide

## A Structured Decompression Conversation After High-Impact Incidents

**Part of the [Resilience by Design](../README.md) toolkit**

---

## Purpose

Closing a case does not mean the team is immediately ready for the next one.

In incident response, the work rarely ends at resolution. Remediation 
continues. Documentation needs to happen. Follow-up actions persist. And 
the cognitive and emotional weight of the incident doesn't disappear when 
the case status changes. For high-impact events—especially those involving 
significant customer impact, extended hours, high ambiguity, or sustained 
pressure—the team needs deliberate space to decompress.

This guide provides a structure for that conversation. It is separate 
from a post-incident review or retrospective, which focuses on what 
happened technically and what should change operationally. This 
conversation focuses on **what the incident cost the people involved** 
and what they need before they take on the next high-pressure event.

Treat this as part of incident closure, not an optional add-on.

## When to Use This

Use this guide after incidents that involved any of the following:

- Extended duration (multi-day, overnight, weekend work)
- High ambiguity or incomplete information over a sustained period
- Significant customer impact, especially where customers experienced 
  distress or major loss
- Heavy decision load concentrated on a small number of people
- Situations where team members operated beyond what felt sustainable
- Emotionally difficult interactions (distressed customers, high-stakes 
  consequences, adversarial dynamics)

You don't need every one of these conditions to be present. Use your 
judgment. If you're asking yourself whether the team needs this 
conversation, they probably do.

## Timing

Hold this conversation within **24–48 hours** of incident closure. 

Soon enough that the experience is still fresh and people haven't 
fully compartmentalized it. Not so soon that people are still in 
response mode and can't reflect.

If the incident involved overnight or weekend work, don't schedule 
this for the next morning. Give people rest first.

---

## Format

- **Keep it small.** This conversation should include the people directly 
  involved in the incident, not a large audience. Psychological safety 
  decreases as group size increases.

- **Keep it informal.** This isn't a structured review with a findings 
  document. It's a check-in. The tone should reflect that.

- **30–45 minutes is usually enough.** Don't force it to fill time, 
  and don't cut it short if people are still talking.

- **The leader or manager facilitates, but this is not about leadership 
  talking.** Your job is to create space, ask questions, and listen. 
  Resist the urge to reassure, solve, or redirect too quickly.

- **This can be done remotely.** For distributed teams, a video call 
  works. Cameras optional—let people choose their comfort level.

## Opening the Conversation

Start by naming what this is and what it isn't.

Something like:

> "This isn't a post-incident review. We'll do that separately. This is 
> a check-in on how everyone's doing after what we just went through. 
> There's no documentation coming out of this. I just want to make sure 
> we have space to talk about what this one cost us before we move on 
> to the next thing."

This framing matters. People in incident response are trained to be 
operational and analytical. If they think this is a review, they'll 
default to technical debriefing. Be explicit that this is different.

## Questions to Guide the Conversation

You don't need to ask all of these. Pick the ones that feel most 
relevant to the specific incident and let the conversation develop 
naturally.

### On the Experience

- How are you feeling now that this one is closed?
- What was the hardest part of this incident for you?
- Was there a point where it felt like too much?
- What moment sticks with you the most?

### On Load and Capacity

- Who carried the heaviest decision load during this incident?
- Did anyone feel like they were operating beyond what was sustainable? 
  At what point?
- Were there moments where you needed help but didn't ask? 
  What got in the way?
- Did the handoffs and escalations work, or did people end up 
  carrying more than they were supposed to?

### On Emotional Impact

- Was there a customer interaction or outcome that hit harder than 
  usual?
- Is there anything from this incident that's still sitting with you?
- For those who worked overnight or extended hours—how are you 
  actually recovering, not just physically but mentally?

### On What Would Help

- What do you need before taking on another high-intensity case?
- Is there anything the team or I could have done differently to 
  reduce the cost of this one?
- What would make the next one like this more sustainable?

## After the Conversation

### Immediate Actions

- **Identify anyone who needs a buffer before their next high-load 
  assignment.** If someone just carried a multi-day incident, routing 
  them straight into the next critical case isn't recovery—it's 
  accumulation. Where possible, create space.

- **Note any structural issues that surfaced.** If the conversation 
  reveals that handoffs broke down, that one person held too much 
  context, or that the rotation wasn't respected, capture those as 
  inputs for operational improvement. Don't let them disappear.

- **Follow up individually.** If someone shared something significant 
  during the group conversation—or was notably quiet—check in with 
  them privately within the next few days.

### Ongoing Patterns

Over time, these conversations produce valuable pattern data:

- Are the same people consistently carrying the highest load?
- Are certain types of incidents producing more team impact than others?
- Is recovery time between incidents shrinking?
- Are the same structural issues surfacing repeatedly without being 
  addressed?

Track these patterns. They connect directly to the 
[Quarterly Team Resilience Review](quarterly-resilience-review.md) 
and the [Rotation and Load Audit](rotation-load-audit.md).

## Common Pitfalls

**Turning it into a technical debrief.** Teams will naturally gravitate 
toward "what happened" rather than "how are we." Gently redirect. The 
technical review has its own time and place.

**Toxic positivity.** Avoid jumping to "but we handled it well" or 
"great job, team" before people have had space to be honest about 
what it cost. Acknowledgment before reassurance.

**Only doing this after the worst incidents.** If you only hold these 
conversations after catastrophic events, the team learns that this 
level of care is reserved for extremes. Building a regular practice 
means people know decompression is part of how the team operates, not 
an emergency measure.

**Skipping it because things seem fine.** High-performing incident 
responders are very good at looking fine. That's part of the problem 
this guide exists to address.

**Not following through.** If someone says they need a buffer and 
they're assigned to the next critical case two days later, the 
conversation was performative. Follow-through is what makes this real.

## A Final Note

Some of the most important moments in these conversations happen after 
the structured questions end. When the formal discussion is wrapping 
up and someone adds one more thing quietly. When someone messages you 
privately afterward. When someone doesn't say much during the check-in 
but accepts your offer to talk one-on-one.

Stay open to those moments. They're often where the real signal is.
