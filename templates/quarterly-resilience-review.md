# Quarterly Team Resilience Review

## A Structured Leadership Self-Assessment for Team Sustainability

**Part of the [Resilience by Design](../README.md) toolkit**

---

## Purpose

Most leadership reviews focus on delivery: What did the team ship? How many 
cases were resolved? What were the response times? Those reviews matter. But 
they only tell you whether the team produced results—not whether the way those 
results were produced is sustainable.

This review is different. It's designed to help leaders step back once a quarter 
and examine the patterns underneath the performance numbers. Where is load 
concentrating? Is recovery actually happening? Are the same structural issues 
surfacing repeatedly? Are early burnout signals present that haven't been 
addressed?

The value of doing this quarterly—rather than only when something goes wrong—is 
that it creates a baseline. Burnout and structural strain accumulate gradually. 
A single snapshot doesn't tell you much. But when you compare this quarter to 
last quarter, trends become visible. You can see whether your team is moving 
toward sustainability or away from it, and you can intervene while there's still 
time to make changes that matter.

This is a private leadership exercise. It's not designed to be shared with the 
team directly, though the actions that come out of it should be visible in how 
you lead.

## When to Use This

- **Once per quarter**, ideally at a consistent time (end of quarter, beginning 
  of quarter—whatever rhythm works for your planning cycle)
- After a sustained period of high-tempo operations, even if it doesn't align 
  with the quarterly cadence
- When you're preparing for staffing conversations, team planning, or 
  leadership reviews and want to bring a resilience perspective alongside 
  the operational one   

Set aside **45–60 minutes** of uninterrupted time. This isn't something to 
rush through between meetings. The quality of the reflection depends on having 
the space to think honestly.

## Part 1: Load and Concentration

This section draws on the 
[Rotation and Load Audit](rotation-load-audit.md). If you've completed a 
recent audit, reference those findings here. If you haven't, answer these 
questions based on your best understanding—but consider running the full 
audit before next quarter.

### Questions   

**Who carried the most weight this quarter?**   

Name the 2–3 people who absorbed the greatest share of high-impact, 
high-pressure, or high-ambiguity work. Don't just think about case count—think 
about decision load, emotional weight, after-hours involvement, and invisible 
effort.   

Names:   
1.   
2.   
3.    

**Has this changed from last quarter?**   

If the same names appear quarter after quarter, that's a structural pattern, 
not a temporary distribution issue.   

[ ] Same people as last quarter   
[ ] Some overlap, some change   
[ ] Meaningfully different distribution   

**Were rotations and boundaries respected this quarter?**   

Think about on-call boundaries, case handoffs, PTO interruptions, and 
after-hours engagement.   

[ ] Generally respected with rare exceptions      
[ ] Overridden or eroded multiple times    
[ ] Routinely not functioning as designed    

If you answered "overridden or eroded multiple times" or "routinely not 
functioning," note the specific patterns:   


**What happened with the concentration risks identified last quarter?**   

If this isn't your first review, check whether the actions you planned 
last quarter actually happened.   
[ ] Actions were completed and concentration improved    
[ ] Actions were partially completed   
[ ] Actions were planned but not executed   
[ ] No actions were identified last quarter   

If actions weren't completed, what got in the way?

## Part 2: Recovery and Sustainability   

### Questions   

**After the highest-impact incidents this quarter, did the team have 
real recovery time?**   

Think about the 2–3 most demanding incidents. Did the people most involved 
get a genuine buffer afterward, or were they immediately routed into the 
next high-load situation?   

[ ] Recovery time was deliberately created after major incidents   
[ ] Recovery happened sometimes but not consistently   
[ ] The team moved directly from one surge to the next with minimal recovery   

**Were post-incident check-in conversations held?**   

Reference the 
[Post-Incident Team Check-In Guide](post-incident-team-checkin.md).   

[ ] Held consistently after high-impact incidents   
[ ] Held sometimes but not as standard practice   
[ ] Not held this quarter   


If they were held, did any recurring themes emerge?      

**How would you characterize the overall pace this quarter?**    
Be honest. Not what you'd report upward—what it actually felt like.     

[ ] Sustainable—the team had capacity for both delivery and recovery   
[ ] Manageable but tight—recovery happened but felt compressed   
[ ] Unsustainable—the team was operating above capacity for extended periods   

**Did anyone on the team take meaningful time off this quarter and 
actually disconnect?**   
[ ] Most team members took time off and genuinely disconnected   
[ ] Some took time off but several remained partially engaged   
[ ] Time off was limited, interrupted, or not truly disconnected for most

## Part 3: Early Signals

This section checks for the burnout indicators described in 
[Section 1 of the toolkit](../toolkit/resilience-by-design-toolkit.md#1-recognizing-early-burnout-signals). 
You're not diagnosing burnout—you're looking for patterns that warrant attention.   

### Questions   

For each signal, note whether you've observed it this quarter and who
it applies to. Be specific—"the team seems a bit tired" isn't actionable. 
Names and patterns are.   

**Has anyone's engagement or curiosity visibly declined?**   

People who used to ask questions in reviews, propose new approaches, or 
engage with learning who have gone quiet or transactional.   
[ ] Not observed   
[ ] Observed — Who:   

**Is anyone consistently stepping in during high-pressure moments in a 
way that suggests the system depends on it?**   

Not just taking on work—being the person who *always* absorbs the hardest 
parts because nobody else does or can.    
[ ] Not observed   
[ ] Observed — Who:   

**Has anyone stopped pushing back?**   

Senior responders or leads who previously challenged decisions, raised 
concerns in reviews, or advocated for different approaches and no longer do.   
[ ] Not observed   
[ ] Observed — Who:   


**Is anyone struggling to disconnect when off rotation or off duty?**   

Logging in after hours, monitoring cases they've handed off, responding to 
messages during PTO or rest days.   
[ ] Not observed   
[ ] Observed — Who:   


**Have you noticed quiet disengagement from anyone?**   

Not visible frustration or complaint—more like withdrawal. Less 
participation, shorter responses, fewer voluntary contributions.   
[ ] Not observed   
[ ] Observed — Who:   


**Are you seeing the team default to familiar approaches rather than 
exploring better ones?**   

Relying on what's known and safe rather than what's most effective. 
Declining curiosity at a team level.   
[ ] Not observed   
[ ] Observed

## Part 4: Invisible Work and Recognition

### Questions   

**Whose contributions this quarter are least visible in your standard 
metrics or reporting?**   

Think about prevention work, mentorship, emotional labor during difficult 
incidents, follow-through after resolution, onboarding support, and 
cross-team relationship maintenance.   


**Did you actively recognize invisible work this quarter?**   

Not just in your own awareness—did you surface it in ways that the 
individuals and the broader team could see?   
[ ] Yes, consistently   
[ ] Sometimes but not consistently   
[ ] Not specifically this quarter   


**Is emotional labor distributed across the team, or concentrated?**   

Think about who manages the most difficult customer interactions, who 
provides emotional steadiness during high-stress incidents, who newer 
team members go to first.   
[ ] Reasonably distributed   
[ ] Somewhat concentrated   
[ ] Heavily concentrated in 1-2 people — Who:   

---

## Part 5: Psychological Safety

### Questions

**Did anyone on the team flag their limits this quarter?**   

Saying "I'm at capacity," asking for help, declining additional work, 
requesting a break after a hard incident.   
[ ] Yes, multiple people — this feels normalized   
[ ] Occasionally, but only certain individuals   
[ ] Rarely or never   

If rarely or never: is that because the team genuinely had capacity, 
or because it didn't feel safe to say otherwise?   


**Did you model limit-setting yourself this quarter?**   

Did you visibly take time off, decline something that exceeded your 
capacity, or express your own limits to the team?   
[ ] Yes   
[ ] Not this quarter   


**Were there moments where someone should have flagged a limit but 
didn't?**   

Times where the cost of not speaking up became visible afterward—someone 
who pushed through when they shouldn't have, a decision that suffered 
because the person making it was at capacity.   

[ ] Not that I'm aware of   
[ ] Yes — What happened:

## Part 6: Your Own Sustainability

This section is about you. Answer honestly. Nobody else needs to see this.   

Reference the [Manager Self-Assessment](manager-self-assessment.md) for 
a deeper version of this reflection.   

**How are you doing?**   

Not how things look, not what you'd say if someone asked in a meeting. 
How are you actually doing?   


**Did you take real time off this quarter?**   
[ ] Yes, and I genuinely disconnected   
[ ] I took time off but stayed partially engaged   
[ ] I didn't take meaningful time off   


**How often did "just this once" happen this quarter?**   
 
Absorbing extra load, stepping in to cover, taking on something that 
wasn't yours because it felt easier than the alternative.   
[ ] Rarely   
[ ] Several times   
[ ] It's become a pattern   


**If you were unavailable for two weeks, what would break?**   


**Are you leading in a way you could sustain for another year?**   
[ ] Yes   
[ ] Probably, but it's getting harder   
[ ] No

## Part 7: Synthesis and Action Planning

### Quarterly Summary   

Based on everything above, write a brief summary of where your team stands. 
Three to five sentences. Focus on the patterns that matter most, not a 
comprehensive recap.   


### Comparison to Previous Quarter   

If this isn't your first review:   
[ ] Overall resilience has improved   
[ ] Roughly the same   
[ ] Conditions have worsened   


What's the most important change—positive or negative—since last quarter?   


### Priority Actions   

Identify **no more than three** actions for the coming quarter. These should 
be specific, achievable, and focused on the most important patterns you 
identified.   

Past experience from other sections of this toolkit applies here: vague 
commitments don't survive contact with operational reality. "Improve work 
distribution" isn't an action. "Ensure that Jordan takes primary on at least 
two of the next five high-impact escalations while Alex is available for 
consultation only" is an action.   

| Priority | Action | Owner | Timeline | How I'll Know It Worked |
|----------|--------|-------|----------|------------------------|
| 1        |        |       |          |                        |
| 2        |        |       |          |                        |
| 3        |        |       |          |                        |

### Follow-Up Commitments

Based on what you've identified, note any specific follow-ups:   

- **1:1 conversations to have:**
- **Structural changes to make or propose:**
- **Things to surface to your own leadership:**

## Keeping a Record

Save each completed review. The cumulative record across quarters is where 
the deepest insights live. You'll be able to see:   

- Whether the same names keep appearing as highest-load carriers
- Whether actions from previous quarters actually produced change
- Whether the overall trajectory is toward sustainability or away from it
- Whether your own sustainability is improving or eroding

A simple format works:   

| Quarter | Key Findings | Actions Planned | Actions Completed | Overall Trajectory |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------|
|         |             |                 |                   |                    |
|         |             |                 |                   |                    |
|         |             |                 |                   |                    |
